# Advanced Data Platform w/ Kubernetes 
## _Objective: Setup a Kubernetes Cluster in Digital Ocean_

### Setup Digital Ocean Environment
1. Went to digitalocean.com, set up an account
2. Deployed 3 Ubunto 18.04(LTS) servers
3. SSH-ed into each using a terminal and updated with most recent versions and installed packages for secure networking and GPG signing:
a. apt update && apt upgrade -y
b. 
```sh
apt install -y \ 
apt-transport-https \ 
ca-certificates \ 
curl \
gnupg-agent \
software-properties-common
```

### Installing WireGuard VPN
I am going to include as many safeguards for secure network traffic as possible. The VPN I installed below makes internal traffic encrypted, probably overkill for 99.9% of usecases but I figure best to play it safe.

1. Adding the WireGuard repository
```sh
add-apt-respoitory -y ppa:wireguard/wireguard
```
